This is a work in progress bear with me.

The end goal is to provide a scalable and highly available web application infrastructure.

To do list
convert existing infrastructure to ansible playbooks and get into a working state
- Remove hard coding
- maintain idempotence
- Add support for Debian distributions
- create firewall/iptables rules
- setup ELK stack
- setup monitoring
  Apache to do list
  - install php-fpm
  - setup memcache for session caching
  Database
  - setup postgresql cluster with pgpool II
  Freeipa
  - add all newly created machines to the freeipa cluster (tired of typing passwords)
Lastly, remove all secondary machines and re-add to cluster/s to make sure its working correctly
